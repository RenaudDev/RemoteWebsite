## Welcome to RemoteUnbound!

Hey there! I’m Renaud Gagne, a 37-year-old remote work enthusiast and the creator of RemoteUnbound. I’ve been living the digital nomad lifestyle since the age of 25, working from my laptop in numerous countries, including the United States, Canada, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, and Costa Rica.

I love the freedom that remote work provides. As a proud husband and father to three amazing children, working from home has allowed me to witness their growth and discoveries firsthand. The flexibility to explore new corners of the world with just my laptop in tow has been a truly enriching experience.

## My Remote Work Journey
My journey into the world of remote work began when I realized that the traditional 9-to-5 job just wasn’t for me. I didn’t have a college or university degree, and my interests were vast and varied. That’s when I stumbled upon the worlds of web development and advertising. I started with affiliate marketing and eventually launched a boutique marketing agency on the West Coast of Vancouver Island 8 years ago.

Today, I’m the Co-Founder of Supersonic Sites®, a web development and advertising agency specializing in helping small local service businesses achieve online success. We’re passionate about providing personalized solutions that make a real difference in our clients’ lives.

## A Passion for Adventure and Travel
On a more personal note, I’ve always been an adventurous spirit with an insatiable curiosity. My love for travel and exploring new cultures is a big part of who I am, and I’m grateful that my remote work lifestyle has allowed me to embrace that passion to the fullest.

## Why RemoteUnbound?
I created RemoteUnbound to share my experiences, tips, and insights on remote work and digital nomad living. My hope is that, by doing so, I can help others find the same freedom and fulfillment that I’ve found in my own life.
