## Actual Expense Method

With the actual expense method, you can claim a deduction based on the percentage of your home used for business purposes. You'll need to calculate this percentage by dividing the square footage of your home office by the total square footage of your home. Then, you can apply this percentage to eligible expenses, such as rent, utilities, and office supplies. This method often results in a larger deduction, but it requires more detailed record-keeping.

### Examples of Deductible Expenses


When using the actual expense method, some deductible expenses include:

*   Rent or mortgage interest
*   Property taxes
*   Utilities (e.g., electricity, gas, water)
*   Office-specific repairs and maintenance
*   Depreciation of the home office portion of the property

Remember to keep accurate records of all these expenses to support your deduction claims.
