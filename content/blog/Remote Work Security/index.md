## What If You Were Hacked?

Are you working from home right now? If so, you're not alone. The pandemic has changed the way we work, and for many of us, that means working remotely. And while remote work has its benefits, like flexibility and no commuting, it also comes with its own set of challenges. One of the biggest challenges is **ensuring the security of your work data**.

With so many of us now working from home, cybercriminals are taking advantage of this shift by targeting remote workers with phishing emails, malware, and other attacks. That's why it's more important than ever to prioritize remote work security.

In this article, we'll share the top 10 remote work security best practices that you need to know. By following these best practices, you can protect your sensitive data and have peace of mind while working from home. So, grab a cup of coffee, and let's get started!

## Secure your Wi-Fi network
{{< responsive-image src="wifi.webp" alt="Wifi Router" >}}

One of the key areas that require attention is your Wi-Fi network.

Your Wi-Fi network is a gateway to your work devices and data. Therefore, it's essential to secure it from potential threats. Here are three best practices to secure your Wi-Fi network:

### Password-protect your Wi-Fi
Setting up a strong password is the first step towards securing your Wi-Fi network. Avoid using default passwords or common phrases that are easy to guess. Instead, use a unique combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Don't share your password with anyone unless it's necessary. Check out this article on how to [change your wifi password](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-change-wifi-password).

### Update your router firmware
Router manufacturers release firmware updates regularly to address security vulnerabilities and improve performance. It's essential to update your router firmware to the latest version to ensure optimal security.

### Use a VPN

A virtual private network (VPN) provides an added layer of security by encrypting your internet connection. It masks your IP address and makes it difficult for hackers to track your online activities. Use a reliable VPN service when working remotely to ensure your data is safe.

Here are some popular VPN services:
- [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/)
- [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/)
- [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/)
- [CyberGhost](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/)
- [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)

## Use strong passwords and a password manager
{{< responsive-image src="password.webp" alt="Password protected computer" >}}

It's more important than ever to have strong passwords and a reliable password manager to keep your online presence secure. We've all been there - using the same password for multiple accounts, or even worse, using a password that's easy to guess. But by using strong, unique passwords and a password manager, you can ensure that your online accounts are safe from prying eyes. Did you know? [A recent study](https://www.enzoic.com/blog/8-stats-on-password-reuse/) found that 73% of users duplicate their passwords in both their personal and work accounts.

First and foremost, it's important to understand the importance of using unique passwords for each of your online accounts. If you use the same password for multiple accounts and that password is compromised, then all of your accounts are at risk. That's why using a password manager is a great solution. A password manager allows you to create complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts and stores them in a secure vault.

Now, you might be thinking, "But I heard that password managers aren't safe either!" While there have been instances of password managers being compromised, the risk is still much lower than using the same weak password for multiple accounts. Sometimes there has to be a trade-off for the average guy. If you are a security freak who has a notebook of unique password that you type by hand every time, fine...but that's just not an option for 99% of people. Plus, most password managers use advanced encryption to keep your passwords safe.

But not all password managers are created equal. It's important to choose a reputable password manager with a track record of security, and to keep it updated with the latest security patches. Digital Trend's article [Using LastPass? You need to switch urgently, says security firm](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/stop-using-lastpass-says-security-firm/) highlights the importance of choosing a reliable password manager, and switching if necessary.

By using strong passwords and a password manager, you can take a significant step towards securing your remote work environment. However, it's just one piece of the puzzle. In the next section, we'll cover the importance of antivirus software and how it can further protect your online presence.

Here are some popular password managers:
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)
- [Keeper](https://keepersecurity.com/)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)

In the virtual world of remote work, we are more vulnerable to the risks of phishing attacks than ever before. Cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated in their approach, using social engineering techniques to trick even the savviest of professionals.

### Identifying Phishing Emails and Messages

Phishing emails often look like they come from legitimate sources such as banks, social media platforms, or even from within your own company. They may include links to websites that look like the real deal, but are actually malicious sites that can install malware on your device or steal sensitive data.

### Verifying the Source Before Clicking Links or Downloading Attachments

It's essential to take a moment to verify the source before clicking on links or downloading attachments. Hover over the link to see if the URL matches the sender's email address or the context of the message. If it doesn't, don't click. Check with the supposed sender through a different channel, such as a phone call or instant message, to verify the authenticity of the email.

### Don't Share Personal Information
Be wary of requests for personal or sensitive information, especially in the form of an email or message. No legitimate company or individual would ask for your social security number or bank account details via email.

It's crucial to be cautious of phishing attempts to protect sensitive data while working remotely. However, in the event of a successful attack, it's essential to ensure that the data stored and shared is secure. 

## Securely store and share sensitive data
{{< responsive-image src="secure-storage.webp" alt="Computer storage protected" >}}

Keeping sensitive data secure is of the utmost importance. From confidential client information to proprietary company data, the risk of data breaches is real. That's why it's critical to have a plan in place for securely storing and sharing sensitive data.

### Using encrypted cloud storage services
One of the easiest ways to store sensitive data is by using encrypted cloud storage services. These services, like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Box, allow you to upload files and access them from anywhere, while also encrypting your data to keep it secure.

When choosing a cloud storage provider, make sure to read up on their security protocols to ensure that your data is being protected. For example, some providers use zero-knowledge encryption, which means that even the provider themselves cannot access your files.

### Safely sharing files with coworkers
When sharing files with coworkers, it's important to ensure that they are also being stored securely. Instead of sending files as email attachments, which can be easily intercepted or forwarded to unauthorized recipients, use a cloud storage service to share the files directly.

To further increase security, use password-protected links or set expiration dates for the links so that the files are only accessible for a limited time.

By taking these precautions, you can ensure that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized parties.

## Limit access to your work devices
