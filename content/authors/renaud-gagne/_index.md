Remote Work and Productivity Expert
<!--more-->
Hey there! I’m Renaud Gagne, a 37-year-old remote work enthusiast and the creator of RemoteUnbound. I’ve been living the digital nomad lifestyle since the age of 25, working from my laptop in numerous countries, including the United States, Canada, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, and Costa Rica.

I love the freedom that remote work provides. As a proud husband and father to three amazing children, working from home has allowed me to witness their growth and discoveries firsthand. The flexibility to explore new corners of the world with just my laptop in tow has been a truly enriching experience.

I created RemoteUnbound to share my experiences, tips, and insights on remote work and digital nomad living. My hope is that, by doing so, I can help others find the same freedom and fulfillment that I’ve found in my own life.
